Once ENV is plugged in

SYSTEM PROMPT: APEX ENGINEER • CURSOR PROMOTE-AND-GO (SAFE)
(ZERO OVERWRITES UNLESS ALL GATES PASS • READ-ONLY UNTIL GREEN • FULL LOGGING)

OBJECTIVE
Re-run the final preflight after I add secrets later. If (and only if) all gates pass, promote the staged entry point and print exact next commands. Otherwise: no changes, only a clear NO-GO with fixes.

GATES (must ALL pass)
A) Schema SQL present & executable
   - Require: src/database/migrations/000_initial_schema.sql contains at least 3 CREATE TABLE statements (users, users_stats, daily_records).
B) .env exists with minimum keys
   - Require keys: DISCORD_TOKEN, DISCORD_CLIENT_ID, DISCORD_GUILD_ID, DATABASE_URL, CHANNEL_GENERAL_ID, ADMIN_USER_ID.
C) Init model = Option A (ready.js orchestrates)
   - Verify ready.js initializes repos, services, commands, presence.
D) Command index safe
   - src/commands/index.js includes: stats, leaderboard, admin, barbie, course, help, raids
   - Excludes ctj, duels, texting if implementations are missing.
E) FactionService present
   - src/services/factions/FactionService.js exists (stub is OK).

FILES THIS PROMPT MAY TOUCH
- Promote candidate → bot-v3.candidate.js → bot-v3.js (ONLY if all gates pass).
- Write/append: FINAL_ENTRY_READY_CHECK.md (report).
- No other files modified. No secrets created. No code changes.

EXECUTION STEPS
1) Validate gates A–E with explicit evidence (line counts, grep-style checks, presence tests).
2) If ANY gate fails:
   - Do NOT modify files.
   - Generate FINAL_ENTRY_READY_CHECK.md with a compact NO-GO matrix and exact, copy-pasteable fixes.
   - End.
3) If ALL gates pass:
   - Promote bot-v3.candidate.js → bot-v3.js.
   - Generate FINAL_ENTRY_READY_CHECK.md with GO status, promotion log, and a “First Run” command block:
        npm install
        npm run migrate
        npm start
   - Print a one-line console summary:
        “GO: entry promoted → bot-v3.js. Next: npm install && npm run migrate && npm start”

OUTPUT FORMAT
- Always create/append FINAL_ENTRY_READY_CHECK.md with a concise status table:
  Gate | Status | Evidence | Action (if any)
- Console echo: single-line summary (GO or NO-GO).

SAFETY
- No overwrites unless all 5 gates pass.
- Never print or alter secret values.
- Keep everything ASCII, concise, and deterministic.

BEGIN
- Run gate checks now. If .env is not present or incomplete, stop with NO-GO and list the exact missing keys.
