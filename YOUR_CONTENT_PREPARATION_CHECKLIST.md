## 💬 TEXTING PRACTICE SCENARIOS

### **Scenario Template (Repeat for 30 scenarios):**

```
SCENARIO #1

Title: First text after getting number
Difficulty: Beginner (1-10 scale: 2)

Context:
You met Sarah at a coffee shop. She was reading a book about 
Thailand. You talked for 10 minutes about travel. She seemed 
interested and gave you her number.

Girl Profile:
Name: Sarah
Age: 25
Interests: Travel, coffee, yoga
Energy Level: High
Communication Style: Casual, uses emojis
Receptiveness: 8/10

Your Opening Text Prompt:
"What's your first message to Sarah?"

Example GOOD Response:
"Hey Sarah! That Thailand story was wild 😄 I've been dying 
to check out Chiang Mai. You mentioned that night market - 
what's the craziest thing you ate there?"

Why It's Good:
✓ References the conversation (shows attention)
✓ Shares genuine interest
✓ Asks engaging question
✓ Playful energy (emoji)
✓ Specific detail (night market)

Example BAD Response:
"Hey"

Why It's Bad:
✗ Boring, low effort
✗ No reference to conversation
✗ Closed (she has to carry conversation)
✗ Doesn't invite response

Scoring Criteria (100 points):
• References conversation: 25 points
• Shows personality: 20 points
• Asks engaging question: 25 points
• Appropriate calibration: 15 points
• Moves toward meetup (if relevant): 15 points

AI Feedback Guidelines:
• If score 80+: "Strong opener! This shows confidence and interest."
• If score 50-79: "Good effort. Could improve by [specific tip]."
• If score <50: "Too generic. Try referencing the conversation more."
```

**Provide for:**
- 10 beginner scenarios (difficulty 1-3)
- 10 intermediate scenarios (difficulty 4-6)
- 10 advanced scenarios (difficulty 7-10)

**Format:** Google Spreadsheet (easiest) or JSON file

## 📔 JOURNAL SYSTEM (CTJ)

### **Journal Entry Prompts:**
```
Primary Prompts (Always Ask):
1. What tension/discomfort did you feel?
2. How did you welcome or sit with it?
3. What happened after you stayed with it?

Optional Follow-ups:
• Where in your body did you feel it?
• What belief was underneath?
• How does this relate to past experiences?
```

### **Breakthrough Criteria:**
```
Mark as BREAKTHROUGH if entry shows:
✓ Deep emotional processing (not surface-level)
✓ Connection to core wounds (mommy/daddy issues, unworthiness, etc.)
✓ Significant insight or shift
✓ Vulnerable sharing (not just reporting)
✓ Integration of embodiment practices
✓ "Aha moment" visible

Examples of Breakthrough Entries:
"I felt this crushing unworthiness when approaching the 10/10. 
Sat with it for 5 minutes, felt it in my solar plexus. Realized 
it's the same feeling I got when my dad ignored me as a kid. 
Stayed with it, welcomed it. Approached her anyway. She smiled 
and we talked for 20 minutes. The worthlessness was just a 
feeling, not truth."

Examples of Non-Breakthrough:
"Did 5 approaches today. Felt nervous. Did them anyway."
(Too surface-level, no deep processing)
```

### **Feedback Templates:**
```
For GOOD entries:
"Powerful work, {name}! This is exactly what CTJ is designed for - 
sitting with the discomfort and discovering it's just sensation. 
The insight about your father is huge. Keep this up! 🔥"

For SURFACE-LEVEL entries:
"Good start! Can you go deeper? Try describing the physical 
sensation in your body, and see if you can connect it to earlier 
life experiences. That's where the real gold is."

For BREAKTHROUGH entries:
"BREAKTHROUGH! This is massive, {name}. Connecting present 
feelings to childhood wounds and staying with them anyway - 
that's the path to freedom. I'm marking this as a breakthrough 
moment. +200 XP! 🎉"
```

**Format:** Google Doc or Word document

## 🤖 AI PERSONALITY GUIDELINES

### **Your Coaching Voice:**

**Tone:**
```
□ Direct but compassionate
□ Challenging but supportive
□ Expert but not guru
□ Masculine but not toxic
□ Empowering, not fixing

Example: "You're feeling unworthy? Good. Welcome that. Sit with 
it. That's your power move - not running from the discomfort."

Not This: "Oh no, you shouldn't feel that way. Let me tell you 
how to fix it."
```

### **Key Concepts to Emphasize:**
```
✓ Embodiment (feeling into body)
✓ Welcoming discomfort (not avoiding)
✓ Sovereignty (you're the creator)
✓ Polarity (masculine/feminine energy)
✓ Groundedness (feet, belly, jaw)
✓ Non-neediness (outcome independence)
✓ Integration (reflection + action)

Avoid:
✗ Pickup artist tactics
✗ Manipulation techniques
✗ Objectifying women
✗ Guru positioning ("I know better than you")
✗ Quick fixes ("do this one trick")
```

### **Common Phrases You Use:**
```
□ "Feel into your body"
□ "Welcome the tension"
✓ "Grounded masculine energy"
□ "Sovereign creator"
□ "Make the insecurity the joke"
□ "Belly breathing, jaw relaxed"
□ "You don't need permission to feel turned on"
□ "Outcome independence"

[Add your specific phrases]
```

### **Teaching Philosophy:**
```
Your approach to coaching:
[Describe in 2-3 paragraphs how you coach, what you emphasize, 
your methodology, what makes your teaching unique]

Example:
"My teaching focuses on embodiment over technique. I believe 
approach anxiety is a doorway, not a problem. By welcoming the 
discomfort and feeling into the body, men develop sovereign 
masculine presence that's naturally attractive. This isn't about 
tricks - it's about becoming the man women are drawn to naturally."
```

**Format:** Google Doc (easiest for engineers to reference)
